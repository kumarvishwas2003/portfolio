        I'm a frontend developer passionate about crafting seamless digital
        experiences. Specialized in React and Tailwind CSS, I love building
        fast, responsive, and visually stunning web applications. Alongside
        modern frontend frameworks, I also excel in WordPress development,
        helping brands and individuals establish a strong online presence with
        dynamic and user-friendly websites. Beyond development, I'm deeply
        invested in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), constantly sharpening
        my problem-solving skills to write efficient and optimized code. As a
        Computer Science Engineering student at MVJ College of Engineering, I’m
        always exploring new technologies, embracing challenges, and pushing
        boundaries in the tech world. Let's connect and build something amazing
        together! ✨
